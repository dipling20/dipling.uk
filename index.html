        <p>Before I begin I'd like to thank you, the visitor, for stumbling across my little corner of the internet.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is this site?</h2>
        <p>This website serves as my personal page and also as my portfolio for whom it may interest.</p>
        <p>It may seem a little lackluster right now, but bear in mind that I'm still setting everything up.</p>
        <p>Also, if you're viewing this on a phone, please don't, it looks shit.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am Dipling, and for reasons that hopefully are obvious, I won't be disclosing much more.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why bother?</h2>
        <p>I will most likely own this domain for the rest of my life, if not longer, as I want to have a fraction of my history engraved into the internet.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I guess I just enjoy doing pointless things.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Where is everything?</h2>
        <p>At the moment, this everything. The rest will come in due time.</p>
